# About Google Sites
I started writing this site in 2018 without considering the existence of better alternatives than Google Site, I was inexperienced at the time, and now who has over 70 pages of guides and insights and thousands of daily visits, it's a shame to have to rewrite it all over again! Over time drerxcellhackers.nethas been the reference point for thousands of enthusiasts, and many of these have also become KaiOS developers through this site. drerxcellhackers.netis definitely the biggest alternative resource to [developer.kaiostech.com](https://developer.kaiostech.com), relying on open source solutions and not on the laws of the mobile market imposed by Google against the hidden power of KaiOS.

Being this site born and created with Google Sites on November 2018 (the original link is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/drerxcellhackers)), it was slave of the Google's rules for a long time, and many times in its history this website has been blocked from Google for suspected "violations of service's terms", and yet its blocking has condemned users who wanted support from these resources.

This repository was created in response to yet another unjustified block (October 18, 2021), so from now you must ONLY rely on the "trusted links" listed on this page (https://drerxcellhackers.netand https://ivan-hc.github.io/drerxcellhackers), because this version is free from cookies and other Google trackers, free from Google's rules and then always available to the users.
